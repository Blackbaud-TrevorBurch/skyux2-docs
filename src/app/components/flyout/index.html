  <sky-demo-page-summary>
    <p>The flyout service launches a container that lays over the page content to show larger amounts of supplementary information related to the user's task. The <stache-code>SkyFlyoutService</stache-code> provider lauches the flyouts with a common look-and-feel for given inner content. The <stache-code>SkyFlyoutInstance</stache-code> class allows you to watch for the flyout being closed and respond accordingly.</p>
    <sky-alert alertType="info">Keep in mind that flyouts are not child components. Any component in a SPA can use <stache-code>SkyFlyoutService</stache-code> to launch a flyout, but the flyout is launched independently through the service.</sky-alert>

    <p>Follow these guidelines to ensure that people can use modals with assistive technology or keyboards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When a flyout opens, focus should be on the first focusable item in the flyout. If the flyout does not include focusable items, then focus should be on the flyout container element.</li>
      <li>While a flyout is open, focus should remain on elements in the flyout when using Tab key to navigate. Focus should not move back to the initiating page behind the flyout. At the end of the flyout, the Tab key should return focus to the first focusable item in the flyout. Conversely, at the top of the flyout, the Shift+Tab keys should switch focus to the last focusable item in the flyout. </li>
      <li>When a flyout closes, focus should return to the element that had focus before the flyout opened. Usually this is the element that opened the flyout.</li>
